K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering. The main goal of the K-Means algorithm is to partition a set of points into K clusters, where each cluster is defined by its centroid (mean), such that the sum of squared distances from all points to their respective centroid is minimized. The algorithm works by initializing K centroids randomly, then repeatedly assigning each data point to the closest centroid and updating the centroid based on the mean of its assigned data points, until convergence. The result is a partitioning of the data into K clusters, where each cluster represents a group of similar data points. The algorithm is widely used for a variety of applications, such as image segmentation, market segmentation, and anomaly detection.
